# cowboy-game
This game was developed as a semestral project for my university Java course. The topic I chose was a game engine for an RPG game, so instead of many levels, there is only one demo level, basic mechanics, and features that enable the game to be expanded and to add more content later.

I selected JavaFX as the main framework because we were forbidden to use any real game engines. I also made all of the sprites and assets myself in [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/). 

Detailed documentation is on the [Wiki](https://github.com/lmnek/cowboy-game/wiki) but written in Czech only.
